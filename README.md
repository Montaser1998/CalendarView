# CalendarView
## Description
This is a simple calendar View Control for Xamarin Forms. It takes the current date of the device and generates the complete layout of the current month.

Is using simple Xamarin Forms controls but more is coming.

## Roadmap
- ItemsSource support (appointments, meetings, etc).
- Themes
- Navigation between dates.
- Selection commands.
- Day, Week, Work Week views???
- Transform this as a plugin.

## To Run
- Visual Studio 2017, Visual Studio for Mac or Jetbrains Rider IDE (I'm using this last one)
- Xamarin Forms 3.5

## Contributions
Contributors are always welcome. If you have an idea please PR that points to master. More info and standards are TBD but I will try to follow the [Xamarin Forms contributing guidelines](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) or something similar.
